You can install this module in the usual Perl way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc:

	perldoc List::Rotation
	
If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file:

	perldoc Rotation.pm
	
You can uninstall the module by calling the script ./lib/uninstall
(coming with this distribution) from your installation directory like:
./lib/uninstall List::Rotation
